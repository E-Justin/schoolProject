This is a sample input file for COSC 1436
assignment #10. Your program should encode this
file by adding four to the AsCII value of each 
character in it. In your encoded file the first character should 
be 'X'. The last character of the first line should be ':'.
The encoded file should have 8 lines of text just like this one,
but will be unreadable. The last character of the last line will 
be a '2'.
