"""Using the die.py and dicedemo.py files as a starting point, create a pigdice.py game that plays the game of Pig

Rules of Pig: (https://www.dicegamedepot.com/dice-n-games-blog/pig-dice-game-rules/). 

Pig involves two players, you and the computer.  You will be rolling the die and displaying your results on the screen.  
The Computer will play in the background and just show their total score in a Label field.

Your screen will look like dicedemo.py, but you will need a few modifications to reflect the rules of Pig:

Add a Label field to display the Computer Total
Add a Label field to show your Total
Only one die needs to be displayed.
Button options are: Roll (your turn), Pass (let the computer process its rolls), and Begin (start the game - other buttons are disabled until you click this one)
For your roll, click the Roll button until you decide to stop.  Remember that if you roll the number 1, you lose all points for that turn.  Click Pass for the 
computer to play.  To simulate the computer's play, you can generate a random number of "times" that the computer will roll, then roll their die until they use up 
all of their rolls or roll a 1.

Keep up with totals for both players and show those totals on the screen.  First one to 100 wins!

Once you have the game working, you could add a message box at the very beginning to explain the game to the user (or create a keyboard listener for the letter 
H to display Help in a message box, if you wanted to get complicated).

The dice images are attached to this assignment and MUST be a subdirectory of your folder where your code resides.  Download, unzip and put them in a folder 
under your source directory called DICE (all caps)."""
